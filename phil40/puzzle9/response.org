5. B did it. A and C are telling the truth.
   Proof:
   - When B says, he doesn't know the guy, B invalidates A's claim
     making him a liar

   - When B says, he was out of town, B invalidates C's claims making
     C a liar

   - Since we can't have two liars, B has to be lying and the other
     two must be telling the truth
