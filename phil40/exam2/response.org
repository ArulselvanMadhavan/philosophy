   changes to our judicial system. Perhaps the best remedy for rushed
   confirmations and politicizing the U.S. Supreme Court is to end
   lifetime appointments. Why not limit justices to terms of 10 years?

9. Clear-eyed on pot. Now that the charade of “medical” marijuana is
   over, we need to be realistic about the impact of legalizing
   recreational use of marijuana. Legalization is needed, because the
   prohibition of marijuana is futile and costly. But the use of
   marijuana comes with the same risks of alcohol and tobacco. It will
   be a public health issue that must be managed. Abuse by adults, use
   by juveniles, use in public, the resultant health effects of
   marijuana use, and driving under the influence of marijuana are all
   legitimate concerns. Recreational use of marijuana should not be
   prohibited, but it should not be glorified either - Paul Joseph,
   San Jose

   - Conclusion:

     - Recreational use of marijuana should not be prohibited, but it
       should not be glorified either.
